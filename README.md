Hi, I’m [Richa](https://www.richas.xyz). I'm building RL environments for AI to solve unsolved physics problems like Navier-Stokes.  Physics progress is stalled by our inability to get better data, compute & infer better models. Icosian is my attempt to accelerate this — by building the platform where frontier knowledge gets created, verified, and structured for AI training.
