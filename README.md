👋 Hi, I'm @richafltr
- 👀 I'm interested in building at the intersection of Cutting Edge Physics and Generative AI.
- 🌱 I'm currently building LearnQuantum which augments the Physical Intelligence in the next generation of AI models useful in Games, and DeepTech.
- 💞️ If the intersection of Physics and AI interests you please reach out.
- 📫 Reach out to me via [founder@learnquantum.co].

### About Me
I am a physicist and AI engineer with a passion for pushing the boundaries of what is possible. My background is in quantum physics and machine learning, and I'm fascinated by the potential for these fields to converge and unlock new frontiers of innovation.

### LearnQuantum
LearnQuantum is my latest project, where I'm working to infuse the next generation of AI models with deeper physical understanding. By integrating the fundamental symmetries in physics in Language Models as a moment of truth effectively like compilers are to Programming Languages, I believe we can create AI systems that can reason about the world in fundamentally more powerful ways.

This has applications in areas like:
- Physical Ingelligence in the next Generation of Models.
- Simulation and optimization for deep tech industries
- Robotic control and autonomous systems
- Scientific discovery and theoretical physics

### Get Involved
If you share my enthusiasm for the intersection of physics and AI, I'd love to connect. Whether you're a fellow researcher, an aspiring engineer, or just someone curious about these topics, I'm always eager to collaborate and learn from others.

Please feel free to reach out to me at [founder@learnquantum.co]. I'm happy to discuss ideas, provide mentorship, or explore potential project opportunities together.

Let's push the boundaries of what's possible!
